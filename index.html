        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>👨‍💻 I’m the type of engineer who runs Linux natively on their laptop and desktop. A fun Saturday for me is building a home server or
          building my own Cloud system. I'm a tech enthusiast who enjoys learning new things and I have a passion for creating and
          problem-solving. I have a strong background in software engineering and I am always looking for new challenges to tackle. With
          me, you’ll be getting an engineer with years of experience and a top-tier AI expert. With nearly a decade of experience, I possess
          a diverse set of skills, and I'm always eager to learn and expand my skill set..</p>
